# Vocales Locas (Crazy Vowels)

I wanted to build a tool for my ESL students to practice English pronunciation. The English language has about 15 vowel sounds, depending on regional dialect. Compared with Spanish, which only has 5 vowel sounds, this can be quite challenging for English learners. This quiz game is designed to help users identify the primary stressed syllable and sound for common English words.

## Future Features

I would love to add in a timer feature and a leader board, so that participants can compete with one another for the top spot. Additionally, it would be great to have different levels. In level 1, users can hear both the words and sounds. In level 2, the users can hear only the word, and level 3 does not include audio at all.
